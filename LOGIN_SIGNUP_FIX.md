# Login & Signup Page - Text Input Fix

## Issue Identified

The login and signup pages had **invisible text input** issues due to poor color contrast:

- **Problem**: Input fields used `bg-black/60` (60% opacity black background)
- **Result**: White text on semi-transparent dark background was nearly invisible
- **Impact**: Users couldn't see what they were typing

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Login Page (`/login/`)

**Changed:**
- Background: `bg-black/60` → `bg-gray-900` (solid dark gray)
- Border: `border-white/20` → `border-white/30` (more visible)
- Placeholder: `placeholder-white/50` → `placeholder-gray-500` (better contrast)
- Added helpful placeholders: "Enter your username", "Enter your password"
- Added autocomplete attributes for better browser support
- Added error message display below each field
- Added focus states with white ring and border

**Result:**
- ✅ Text is now clearly visible when typing
- ✅ Better visual feedback on focus
- ✅ Error messages display properly
- ✅ Improved accessibility

### ✅ Signup Page (`/signup/`)

**Changed:**
- Background: `bg-black/60` → `bg-gray-900` (solid dark gray)
- Border: `border-white/20` → `border-white/30` (more visible)
- Placeholder: `placeholder-white/50` → `placeholder-gray-500` (better contrast)
- Added helpful placeholders for all fields
- Added autocomplete attributes
- Added comprehensive error message display
- Added password help text display
- Added focus states

**Result:**
- ✅ All three fields (Username, Password, Confirm Password) are now readable
- ✅ Password requirements are displayed
- ✅ Validation errors show clearly
- ✅ Better user experience
